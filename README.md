# MusicApp

Simple Angular project displaying data from spotify such as tracks, albums, artists. Data is being fetched from [express.js backend proxy](https://github.com/u5s10/express-spotify-api). Application was made to familiarize myself with Angular concepts such as Routing, working with Services and rxjs Observables.


## Live demo 

 App is deployed on netifly and can be access from here [MusicApp](https://wizardly-pasteur-508b06.netlify.app/)

## Running app localy 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/u5s10/angular-spotify-app.git
cd angular-spotify-app
npm install
```

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
